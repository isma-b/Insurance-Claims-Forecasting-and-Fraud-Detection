# Insurance-Claims-Forecasting-and-Fraud-Detection
Overview

This project explores how data science can strengthen decision-making in the insurance industry by combining time series forecasting and fraud detection within a single analytical framework. Using real-world claim and policy data, the notebook predicts future claim volumes while identifying potentially fraudulent claims based on historical patterns and anomalies.

The goal is to demonstrate how a modern insurer could use predictive analytics to anticipate workload, manage risk exposure, and reduce financial losses due to fraud. The project blends business reasoning, statistical rigor, and machine learning into one cohesive story.

Business Context

Insurance companies operate in a space where uncertainty is constant. Every claim represents both a financial liability and an opportunity to deliver on trust. Two recurring questions drive data strategy in this sector:

How many claims should we expect in the near future?
Predicting claim volumes helps allocate resources, estimate reserves, and plan budgets.

Which claims appear suspicious or inconsistent with historical behavior?
Detecting anomalies and fraud early protects profitability and strengthens client trust.

This project addresses both challenges simultaneouslyâ€”using data as the foundation for proactive decision-making.

Objectives

Forecast claim volumes for upcoming months using time series analysis.

Detect potential fraudulent claims based on historical data and claim-level indicators.

Generate interpretable insights for executives, risk analysts, and operations teams.

Data

The analysis uses the public Insurance Claims and Policy Data available on Kaggle
